- **Persistent Operations**: Custom operations are automatically saved and restored between Slack sessions.

### Built-in AI Actions
The following actions are available from the AI menu:
1. **üìù Improve Writing**: The default action. Corrects grammar and improves the overall phrasing and flow of your message.
2. **üåê Translate to English**: Translates the message text into English.

## üåê External Script Loading

The extension supports loading additional functionality from external sources.
